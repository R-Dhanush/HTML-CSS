        <h2>Unordered List</h2>
        <p>The ul tag is used to create a unordered list.<br>For example: <b>How to make a tea?</b></p>
        <p><b>Ingredients</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li> 1 cup of water</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons of black tea or 1 teabag or 1 Tea Drop</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of brown sugar or your alternative sweetener</li>
            <li>Â¼ cup of your preferred milk</li>
        </ul>
        <hr>
        <h2>Ordered List</h2>
        <p>The ol is used to create a ordered list.<br>For example: <b>How to make a tea?</b></p>
        <p><b>Instructions</b></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Begin with boiling water in a pan or kettle. Be sure to use fresh water and spring water or filtered water is always best.</li>
            <li>In your cup, add your teabag or your tea drop. If using loose leaf tea you will need to put this in an infuser or tea strainer.</li>                
            <li>Add your hot water to the cup and let the brew steep for 5 minutes. The longer you leave it to brew the stronger the tea will be. Don't leave it too long as it may become bitter.</li>
            <li>Strain the tea or remove the teabag. If using Tea Drops the drop will simply dissolve.</li>
            <li>Add in your sugar and stir well until all the sugar has dissolved.</li>    
            <li>Pour in your milk one splash at a time, of course, you can adjust the amount until you reach your desired color and consistency.</li>
            <li>Stir once more and then sit back and enjoy your perfect cup of tea.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Definition List</h2>
        <p>The dl tag is used to list up terms and its definition.Inside dl there to two tags dt and dd,dt starnds for definition term and dd starnds for definition descirption.</p>
        <p>For example:<b>Types of loops</b></p>
        <dl>
            <dt>Entry controlled loop</dt>
            <dd>In an entry control loop in C, a condition is checked before executing the body of a loop. It is also called as a pre-checking loop.</dd>
            <dt>Exit controlled loop</dt>
            <dd>In an exit controlled loop, a condition is checked after executing the body of a loop. It is also called as a post-checking loop.</dd>
        </dl>
        <h2>Nested List</h2>
        <p>A list can be nested into another list.<br>For example:<b>Types of loops</b></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Entry controlled loop
                <ul>
                    <li>The for loop</li>
                    <li>The while loop</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Exit controlled loop
                <ul>
                    <li>The do-while loop</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
